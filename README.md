<h2>Week Three</h2>
<h4>Step into my Python journey, where I've honed skills in algorithm development, harnessed the power of regular expressions to find patterns, and mastered the art of working with strings. While my completed labs are locked, you can follow my learning path to discover the world of Python's string manipulation and pattern recognition. Dive in with the links below and unlock the potential of Python in your coding endeavors.</h4>
